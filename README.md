## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Mechanical Engineer** with **3+ years of experience** building AI-powered solutions for the industrial sector. I specialize in combining **machine learning**, **generative AI**, and **mathematical optimization** to solve complex reliability and asset management challenges in the **oil & gas industry**.

Currently at **Yara Brasil** (via Timenow Engenharia), I develop systems that optimize **R$200M+ CAPEX portfolios**, predict equipment failures with **90% accuracy**, and automate decision-making processes that save millions annually.

### 💡 What I Do

🤖 **Generative AI & LLMs**: Building multi-agent systems with RAG (LangChain, LangGraph) for industrial knowledge management  
📊 **Predictive Analytics**: Developing ML models for predictive maintenance and failure forecasting  
⚙️ **Mathematical Optimization**: Applying portfolio theory and linear programming to CAPEX allocation  
🔄 **Data Engineering**: Creating ETL pipelines integrating SAP PM, Meridium, and financial systems  
📈 **Business Intelligence**: Designing executive dashboards that drive strategic decisions
